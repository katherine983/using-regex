AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty in older people is a syndrome related to aging that is 
      becoming increasingly common and problematic as the average age of the world 
      population increases. Detecting frailty in its early stages or, even better, 
      predicting its appearance can greatly benefit health in later years of life and 
      save the healthcare system from high costs. Machine Learning models fit the need 
      to develop a tool for supporting medical decision-making in detecting or 
      predicting frailty. METHODS: In this review, we followed the PRISMA methodology 
      to conduct a systematic search of the most relevant Machine Learning models that 
      have been developed so far in the context of frailty. We selected 41 publications 
      and compared them according to their purpose, the type of dataset used, the 
      target variables, and the results they obtained, highlighting their shortcomings 
      and strengths. RESULTS: The variety of frailty definitions allows many problems 
      to fall into this field, and it is often challenging to compare results due to 
      the differences in target variables. The data types can be divided into gait 
      data, usually collected with sensors, and medical records, often in the context 
      of aging studies. The most common algorithms are well-known models available from 
      every Machine Learning library. Only one study developed a new framework for 
      frailty classification, and only two considered Explainability. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      review highlights some gaps in the field of Machine Learning applied to the 
      assessment and prediction of frailty, such as the need for a universal 
      quantitative definition. It emphasizes the need for close collaboration between 
      medical professionals and data scientists to unlock the potential of data 
      collected in hospital and clinical settings. As a suggestion for future work, the 
      area of Explainability, which is crucial for models in medicine and health care, 
      was considered in very few studies.

TI  - Use of Artificial Intelligence in the Identification and Diagnosis of Frailty 
      Syndrome in Older Adults: Scoping Review.
PG  - e47346
LID - 10.2196/47346 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty syndrome (FS) is one of the most common noncommunicable 
      diseases, which is associated with lower physical and mental capacities in older 
      adults. FS diagnosis is mostly focused on biological variables; however, it is 
      likely that this diagnosis could fail owing to the high biological variability in 
      this syndrome. Therefore, artificial intelligence (AI) could be a potential 
      strategy to identify and diagnose this complex and multifactorial geriatric 
      syndrome. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review was to analyze the 
      existing scientific evidence on the use of AI for the identification and 
      diagnosis of FS in older adults, as well as to identify which model provides 
      enhanced accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC). 
      METHODS: A search was conducted using PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for 
      Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines on 
      various databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The search 
      strategy followed Population/Problem, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome 
      (PICO) criteria with the population being older adults; intervention being AI; 
      comparison being compared or not to other diagnostic methods; and outcome being 
      FS with reported sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, or AUC values. The results 
      were synthesized through information extraction and are presented in tables. 
      RESULTS: We identified 26 studies that met the inclusion criteria, 6 of which had 
      a data set over 2000 and 3 with data sets below 100. Machine learning was the 
      most widely used type of AI, employed in 18 studies. Moreover, of the 26 included 
      studies, 9 used clinical data, with clinical histories being the most frequently 
      used data type in this category. The remaining 17 studies used nonclinical data, 
      most frequently involving activity monitoring using an inertial sensor in 
      clinical and nonclinical contexts. Regarding the performance of each AI model, 10 
      studies achieved a value of precision, sensitivity, specificity, or AUC ≥90. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this scoping review clarify the overall status of 
      recent studies using AI to identify and diagnose FS. Moreover, the findings show 
      that the combined use of AI using clinical data along with nonclinical 
      information such as the kinematics of inertial sensors that monitor activities in 
      a nonclinical context could be an appropriate tool for the identification and 
      diagnosis of FS. Nevertheless, some possible limitations of the evidence included 
      in the review could be small sample sizes, heterogeneity of study designs, and 
      lack of standardization in the AI models and diagnostic criteria used across 
      studies. Future research is needed to validate AI systems with diverse data 
      sources for diagnosing FS. AI should be used as a decision support tool for 
      identifying FS, with data quality and privacy addressed, and the tool should be 
      regularly monitored for performance after being integrated in clinical practice.
